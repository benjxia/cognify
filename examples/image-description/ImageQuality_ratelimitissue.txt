Original result before optimization | quality: 6.97, cost@1000: $0.16, avg latency: 2.78s
================ Optimization Results =================
Optimized for: quality, cost, latency
Based on current optimization parameters, the best solution is the original workflow.
We recommend increasing the number of trials or relaxing constraints.
