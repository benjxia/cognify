Original result before optimization | quality: 7.23, cost@1000: $1.99, avg latency: 3.48s
================ Optimization Results =================
Optimized for: quality, cost, latency
Based on current optimization parameters, the best solution is the original workflow.
We recommend increasing the number of trials or relaxing constraints.
