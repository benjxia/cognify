Programming Interfaces
***********************

Cognify supports several workflow programming models, including ``LangChain`` and ``DSPy``.

We also offer a simple *Cognify programming interface* for you to write workflows from scratch or manually port your existing Python programs.

In this section, we explain each of these programming interfaces using a unified example: `Math Problem Solver <https://github.com/GenseeAI/cognify/blob/main/examples/math/workflow.py>`_.

The workflow contains two agents called in sequence:

1. **Math Interpreter Agent**: This agent analyzes the problem and form a math model.

2. **Solver Agent**: This agent computes the solution by solving the math model generated in the previous step.
